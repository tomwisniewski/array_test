This repo contains my response to a coding challenge set in 2013 by Evgeny Shadchnev at Makers Academy.

Task 1 Details
Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc but work on your own.

Reopen the Array class.
Rewrite the inject method (with the same basic functionality). Write a test for it first. Don't worry about returning an enumertor, assume a block is always given.
Rewrite the reduce method in the same way.
